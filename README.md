# Sketchpy

It is a library in python,  used to create sketches & drawings programmatically. 
In this project, I've just explored it's 2 main modules- library & canvas.

The 'library' modules contain the predefined sketches & drawings, that can be imported & used directly.
The 'canvas' module on the other hand is used to create & manipulate drawing canvas.
